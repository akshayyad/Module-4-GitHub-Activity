[Ananya] Once upon a time, there was a very lonely old woman who lived all by herself in a mansion.
She didn't have any connections to the outside world because she had no friends or family.
In her spare time she was pursuing her degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, virtually, in Computer Science and Neurobiology.
She also enjoyed playing the guitar and piano. 
Other than that, she didn't have much to do since she had no connections.
She decided one day, that she would go down to her basement and tidy it up since it was full of old items.
She decided she would put her rock collection next to her book collection so that it would be ordered properly.
After a few hours, she had organized the basement to her liking.
The next day, she decided she wanted to go back down to the basement to go grab a book.
When she went downstairs, she realized her basement didn't look anything like how she had organized it the day prior.
Her books were all over the floor and her rock collection was completely missing!
She decided to explore to see if she could figure out how this happened.

The old woman, with plenty of time to spare since she didn't have friends or family to spend it with, decided to do a little experiment with the occult. The most probable reason
for why the basement was different was probably because she was going senile in her old age, but she had to be sure that it wasn't a ghost or something paranormal! So the next
day, she set up a tiny, little camera hidden between the pages of her favorite book in her prized collection. That night, she got into bed and told herself goodnight, excited to
see if someone new would be visiting her mansion for the first time in 30 years, ghost or otherwise. She wakes up the next day and rides her stair lift down to her office to watch
the camera feed. What she saw absolutely shocked her, and she knew her life would never be the same again!
